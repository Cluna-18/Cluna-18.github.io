## Technology Stack Overview

##### Front End 
* Technologies Used: The frontend is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user interface that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.

* User Interface: Features a clean and modern design with easy navigation. Interactive elements like modals, dropdowns, and responsive forms enhance user engagement.

So from a design aspect, I wanted the website to look modern and clean. I had used bootstrap to help with this goal. If you are unfamiliar with bootstrap, it is an open source CSS framework that allows users to select from a wide selection of templates that make development faster so developers can focus more on development rather than design. I used a bootstrap template as a starting point to get an idea of how I wanted to set up the site and then added changes where I deemed necessary to make it unique and also fit a theme. 



##### Back End 
* Server-Side Processing: Utilizes Java with the Spring Boot framework for robust server-side logic, handling requests and responses efficiently.

* API Integration: RESTful API architecture facilitates communication between the frontend and the backend, supporting features like user authentication, data retrieval, and post management.

* Security Measures: Implements security best practices such as secure HTTP headers, encrypted passwords, and protection against SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Deployment utilizes Spring Boot’s embedded server capabilities, simplifying the launch process and ensuring compatibility across different environments. Testing across multiple stages ensures stability and performance optimizations.

#### Database

* Data Storage: Uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and manage user data, posts, and community interactions securely.
* 
* Schema Design: Well-structured database schema supports efficient data querying and scalability. Relationships between tables are optimized for performance.
